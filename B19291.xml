            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Trusty and Well-beloved, We greet you well. Whereas Our Royal Father of Blessed Memory, did in the year <hi>1632.</hi> Constitute and Establish a Society of <hi>Fishers,</hi> and Declared that He was resolved by all good occasions favourably to assist, and graciously accept the forwardness of all those that should express their zeal to His Majesties Service in so general and publick an Undertaking; It being then Resolved and Concluded by His Majesty, that it was very honourable and necessary for this Kingdom. Now that the true managing and most advantageous prosecution thereof, is by experience discovered by <hi>Philip</hi> late Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery</hi> and his Associates, who did cause sundry Fishing Vessels to be provided and built, which imployed many Families in making of Nets and other Provisions (one Vessel imploying Twenty Families in work) besides the breeding of Country Youths to be made service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mariners in short time, as by the Book called <hi>The Royal Herring Buss Fishings,</hi> presented unto Us, doth plainly appear. And whereas We are informed that the Nation doth abound with great numbers of poor Families and Vagrants, who for want of imployment are like to perish, unlesse some speedy care be taken for their Relief: And that the several Wards and Suburbs of this Our City of <hi>London</hi> and Hamblets adjacent, are burthened with multitudes of poor people, not only which are born in the said places, but such as come out of sundry Countryes to seek Relief: For Redress whereof, We do hereby recommend unto the care of You Our Lord Maior of the said City, to advise with each Alderman, and cause his Ward-moote Inquest to give in a particular of all the poor Inhabitants within his Ward, what their Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, and how many are without Imployment, and present the same to the rest of the Inhabitants in his Ward, with a Copy thereof, and excite them to a free Subscription for raising a Stock to buy Hemp and Clapboards to make Herring Fishing-Nets, and Barrels for the furnishing and fitting out of one Buss or Fishing Vessel to belong to the said Ward, which will give all the Poor and Vagrants Imployment; the said Ward husbanding the same to their best advantage. The which <hi>We</hi> shall in like manner recommend to all the Counties, Cities, and Towns within our Dominions, whereby to make it a National Imployment for the general good, and will give all fitting assistance to the Undertakers for their encouragement. That so when Provisions shall be made ready and Store-houses built in commodious places about the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> (where breaches have been made) and the like in the several Ports, Magazines may be fitted with Nets, Caske, Salt and all things in readinesse, the Busses may all go forth to Our Island of <hi>Sheteland</hi> as their Rendezvouz to keep together in their Fishing, according to certain Orders prescribed in the aforesaid Book. And to take that Priviledge of the Fishing-grounds which belongs to Us before all Nations whatsoever. And so <hi>We</hi> bid you heartily farewell.</p>
